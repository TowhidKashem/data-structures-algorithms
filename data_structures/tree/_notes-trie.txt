Tries (Prefix Trees):

    - often used with text values for searching
        - used to see if a word/s exists within a given path
            e.g. word search game, auto completion, dictionary, etc

    - can outperform BSTs, hash tables and most other data structures for text searches

    - starts with an empty root node
    
    - Complexity:
        - O (length of word) for lookups
        - good for space complexity
            - you only have 26 nodes max (a - z), all words branch off from these
            - words that are made of the same characters as smaller words branch off them avoiding duplication
