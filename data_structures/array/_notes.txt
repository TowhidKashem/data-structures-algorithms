Arrays (aka "Lists"):

    We know the index:

        Lookups     - O(1)

    After insert or delete the rest of the items need to be shifted/their place updated:

        Insert      - O(n)
        Delete      - O(n)

    It's at the end so no other val needs to be updated:

        Append      - O(1)

    2 types of arrays:

        1. Static arrays    - you define how many items an array will hold when making the array, low level languages like C has these
        2. Dynamic arrays   - high level languages like JavaScript and Python uses these, automatically allocates space in memory (i.e. expands) based on value length

    Notes
        * Treat string problems as array problems, most can be solved using arrays
        * Arrays are great for storing sorted data and therefore to use in sorting problems

    Pros:
        * Fast Lookups
        * Fast push/pop
        * Storing ordered data
    
    Cons:
        * Slow inserts
        * Slow deletes
        * Fixed size (if using static arrays)
