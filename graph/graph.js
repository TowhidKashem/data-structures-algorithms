// Three ways to write graphs:

// 1. Edge List
const graph = [
  [0, 2],
  [2, 3],
  [2, 1],
  [1, 3],
];

/*

Explanation:
    * 0 is connected to 2
    * 2 is connected to 3
    * 2 is also connected to 1
    * 1 is connected to 3

*/

// 2. Adjacency List
const graph = {
  0: [2],
  1: [2, 3],
  2: [0, 1, 3],
  3: [1, 2],
};

/*

Explanation:
    * The index represents the nodes, and the data represents the connections of that node
    * 0 is connected to 2
    * 1 is connected to 2 and 3
    * 2 is connected to 0, 1 and 3
    * 3 is connected to 1 and 2


// Array implementation (not recomended)
// The index represents the node (array implementation only works for when the nodes hold numeric and sequential values)
const graph = [
  [2],          // 0
  [2, 3],       // 1
  [0, 1, 3],    // 2
  [1, 2],       //3
];

*/

// 3. Adjacency Matrix
const graph = {
  0: [0, 0, 1, 0],
  1: [0, 0, 1, 1],
  2: [1, 1, 0, 1],
  3: [0, 1, 1, 0],
};

/*

Explanation:
    * Each array holds either 1s or 0s
        * 1 = connected
        * 0 = not connected

        *** IMPORTANT: Instead of 0 and 1s you can use any number here to describe "weights" if this is a weighted graph

    * 0 is connected to 2 only
    * 1 is connected to 2 and 3
    * 2 is connected to 0, 1 and 3
    * 3 is connected to 1 and 2

** nodes can't be connected to themselves (0)

// Array implementation (not recomended)
// The index represents the node (array implementation only works for when the nodes hold numeric and sequential values)
const graph = [
  [0, 0, 1, 0], // 0
  [0, 0, 1, 1], // 1
  [1, 1, 0, 1], // 2
  [0, 1, 1, 0], // 3
