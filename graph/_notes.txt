Graphs:

    - Vertex = node

    - Edge = path between nodes

    --

    - Ideal data structure for mapping relationships

    - Linked lists are a type of Tree which is a type of Graph

    - Types of graphs:

        1. Directed - can only traverse in a single direction (uni-directional)
            e.g. twitter followee/follower relationship
        2. Undirected - can traverse in any direction (bi-directional)
            e.g. facebook friend relationship

        --

        1. Weighted - information is stored in the edges
            e.g. google maps shortest path from point A to point B 
            (each edge holds a numeric value representing the distance in miles between nodes)

        2. Un-weighted - no information held in the edges, all paths between nodes are the same

        *** Weighted graphs are often used when trying to determine the most optimal path to reach a node

        1. Cyclic - at least some nodes connected to each other by paths

        2. Acyclic - no nodes are connected to each other
