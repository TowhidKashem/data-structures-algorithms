Notes:

Big O measures the number of operations in a function:

    // No matter how large the "boxes" input this function is O(2)
    function logFirstTwoBoxes(boxes) {
      console.log(boxes[0]);  // O(1)
      console.log(boxes[1]);  // O(1)
    }

    O(1) + O(1) = O(2)

---

* O(1) - Constant time:

    - no matter how large the input there is only one operation

    - e.g. accessing an array value by index: arr[0]

    - technically a function can be O(22), O(1000), etc but we usually just sum it up as O(1) or constant time

    - rating: "excellent" (flat line)


* O(log n) - Logarithmic time:

    - when you look for a word in a dictionary (an alphabetically "sorted" data set), you don't look at every single word one by one O(n) 
      instead you do "divide and conquer" by flipping to the letters page then eventually finding the word O(log n)

    - rating: "good" (slight rise)


* O(n) - Linear time:

    - "n" represents the input, the bigger the input the longer the run time:

        input:          [1, 4, 5]
        complexity:     O(3)

        input:          ['hey']
        complexity:     O(1)

    - e.g. looping over an entire array

    - rating: "fair" (line rises with input size)


  * O(n^2) - Quadratic time:

    - nested loops

    - if you have 3 nested loops it will be O(n^3), 4 nested loops O(n^4) etc..

    - rating: "horrible" (line rises sharply as input size increases)



Rare:

  * O(n!) - Factorial time

    - if you are doing this you're doing something really wrong

    - for each input there is a nested loop

    - rating "can't get any worse"

Usually you'll never see exact numbers in simplified Big O expressions, the only numbers you'll see are:

  O(1)    - constant
  O(2n)   - 2 loops side to side (can be 5n 6n etc..)
  O(n^2)  - nested loops

What is the Big O of this function:

    function anotherFunChallenge(input) {
      let a = 5;    // O(1)
      let b = 10;   // O(1)
      let c = 50;   // O(1)

      // let i = 0; // O(n)
      for (let i = 0; i < input; i++) {
        let x = i + 1;  // O(n)
        let y = i + 2;  // O(n)
        let z = i + 3;  // O(n)
      }

      // let j = 0; // O(n)
      for (let j = 0;  j < input; j++) {
        let p = j * 2;  // O(n)
        let q = j * 2;  // O(n)
      }

      let whoAmI = "I don't know";  // O(1)
    }

Answer:

  O(4) + O(7n) = O(4+7n)

Or simplified as:

  O(n)

Rules to simplify Big O:

  1. Worst case                   - e.g. if there's an arr[0] and a loop over same array we drop the O(1) and just use the O(n)
  2. Remove constants             - e.g. O(2n) -> O(n)
  3. Different terms for inputs   - different inputs must be considered seperately, e.g.

    function compressBoxes(boxes, boxes2) {
      boxes.forEach(box => { //... });
      boxes2.forEach(box => { //... });
    }

    these 2 loops aren't iterating over the same input, "boxes" and "boxes2" can have different lengths. so the Big O here isn't O(n) but O(a + b) or O(n + n)

  4. Drop non dominant terms      - same as simplifying, just drop the lesser of the two, e.g.

    function logAllNumsThenAllPairSums(numbers) {
      console.log('these are the numbers:');
      numbers.forEach(num => {
        console.log(num)
      });

      console.log('these are their sums:');
      numbers.forEach(num1 => {
        numbers.forEach(num2 => num1 + num2);
      });
    }

    the non-simplified Big O of this function is O(n + n^2) but we only keep the bigger of the 2 so simplified it becomes O(n^2).
    Even something as complex as O(n^2 + 3n + 100 + n/2) simply becomes O(n^2)

Space complexity:

  When a program runs it has 2 ways of remembering things in memory:

    1. Heap (where variables are stored)
    2. Stack (we keep track of function calls)

  These things add to space complexity:

    1. variables
    2. data structures
    3. function calls
    4. allocations

  all 4 of these are happening here:

    function foo() {
      const pets = [];    // defined variable + created data structure
      pets[0] = 'Penny';  // allocated a value in data structure
    }

    foo();                // made function call

---

  This is O(1) space complexity:

    function sayHey(n) {
      for (let i = 0; i < n.length; i++) {
        console.log('hey!');
      }
    }

    sayHey([1, 2, 3, 4, 5]); // O(1) bc length of input doesn't matter, we are defining a variable only once (let i = 0;)


  This is of O(n) space complexity:

    function sayHeyNTimes(n) {
      const heyArr = [];                        // O(1) but we ignore this during simplifying
      for (let i = 0; i < n.length; i++) {      // O(n)
        heyArr[i] = 'hey!';
      }
      return heyArr;
    }
