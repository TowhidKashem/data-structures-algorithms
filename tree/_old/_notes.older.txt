    Common binary search tree questions:

        - Given a value insert it at the appropriate spot on the tree
        - Validate the well formedness of a tree

    * Recursion is often used to traverse binary search trees

    The 2 algorithms to traverse the entirety of a tree are:

        - Breadth first traversal
        - Depth first traversal


    *** Didn't get how to validate a binary search tree, revisit later: https://www.udemy.com/course/coding-interview-bootcamp-algorithms-and-data-structure/learn/lecture/8547260#content



    const tree = {
        nodes: [{
            data: 20,
            children: [{
            data: 0,
            children: [{
                data: 12,
                children: null
            }, {
                data: -2,
                children: null
            }, {
                data: 1,
                children: null
            }]
            }, {
                data: 40
            }, {
                data: -15,
                children: [{
                    data: -2,

                }]
            }]
