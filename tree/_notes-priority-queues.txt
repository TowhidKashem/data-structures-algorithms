Priority Queue:

    - most often implemented using Binary Heaps
        - can also be implemented using arrays but it's slower

    - ususally a lower value = higher priority, so min heaps are used instead of max heaps
        - also queue = FIFO (first in first out), first number < last number, so first = higher priority

    - like a typical queue that's used to hold things except we can also assign priority to each item

    - differs from binary heaps in that left and right relationships exist
        - the left node has higher priority than the right node
            - e.g. priority queue to get into an airplane (pilot > stewardess > passengers):
