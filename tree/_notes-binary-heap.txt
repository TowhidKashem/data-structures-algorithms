Binary Heaps:

We can use a Binary Tree data structure to represent a Binary Heap but an easier way is to use an array since it's built in:

                    10
                19      36
             17     12       5

   myHeap = [10, 19, 36, 17, 12, 5]

   indices: [0,  1,  2,  3,  4,  5]

******************

Formula to find the children of a node in the array (n = index of the node):

    left child  = 2n + 1
    right child = 2n + 2

******************

the children of '10' are '19' and '36' because:

    left node:
        10 = 0 index
        2 * 0 = 0 
        0 + 1 = 1 index

    right node:
        10 = 0 index
        2 * 0 = 0
        0 + 2 = 2 index

    myHeap[1] = '19'
    myHeap[2] = '36'

the children of '19' are '17' and '12':

    left node:
        19 = 1 index
        2 * 1 = 2
        2 + 1 = 3 index

    right node:
        19 = 1 index
        2 * 1 = 2
        2 + 2 = 4 index

    myHeap[3] = '17'
    myHeap[4] = '12'


******************

Formula to find the parent of a node (n = index of the node):

    (n - 1) / 2 floored

******************

Find the parent of '17':

    myHeap[3] = 17

    (3 index - 1) = 2 / 2 = 1

    myHeap[1] = 19

Find the parent of '12':

    myHeap[4] = 12

    (4 index - 1) = 3 / 2 = 1.5 -> floor -> 1

    myHeap[1] = 19

******************

Insertion:

    1. New node is added to the END of the tree
    2. Then we "bubble up" (if needed):
        - we recursively keep comparing the new node to it's parent, if it's bigger we swap (in max heap)
          and so on and so on until the node arrives at it's correct spot

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Notes:

    - same as a Binary Search Trees in structure, just differs in the rules of ordering
        - binary = each parent has at most 2 nodes
        - there is no left to right relationships, only up and down

    - used in algorithms where order is important (e.g. "Priority Queues", sorting algorithms, data storage)

        - e.g. let's say we have a Max Binary Heap where the values are the ages of all children in a school
          and we need to grab all kids above the age of 10, in a Binary Heap this is easy, we just need to traverse the
          tree and grab nodes until we get to a value of 10 or greater and then we just stop
            - in a BST, array or object this would be a O(n) operation

Complexity:

    - lookups are O(n) unlike BSTs which are O(log n) on average
        - this is because the rules of ordering are more strict in BSTs than in heaps hence there are more nodes to check
    - while searching a Binary Heap is slower than a BST but it's useful because it tracks priority relationships between nodes

---

Max Binary Heap:

    - parent nodes are always LARGER than the children
        - every level will have values doing down

Min Binary Heap:

    - parent nodes are always SMALLER than the children
        - every level will have values going up
